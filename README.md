# Simple Implementation of Strategy Pattern.

###### Very handy when you want to define a class that will have one behaviour that is similar to other behaviours in a list.
###### When you need to use those objects dynamically.
###### Often reduces long list of conditionals
###### If changes in one class doesnâ€™t force other classes to change
###### Only drawback is - Increased number of objects
